# ft_ls

ft_ls project from 42 School


## Description

The ls command is one of the first commands you have learned to use with shell. It is
also one you are using the most. Perhaps you have already asked yourself how is this
function coded? Thanks to this project, you will soon find out.
To Recode ls and some of its options will allow you to find out how to interact with
the file system using C. After all, you already know how to open, read, write and close a
file. But, what about the directories? Special files? Rights, dates or sizes of the files?
And while I am on the topic, the quality of your libft will make the difference
between a pleasant project experience and an abominable one. For example, if you add
ft_printf to your libft, your life will be more enjoyable. It is possible to complete the
ft_ls project without the ft_printf function. By the same token, you can easily eat a
yogurt with your fingers. A spoon would still make your experience more pleasant
